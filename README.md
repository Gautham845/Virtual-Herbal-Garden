Virtual Herbal Garden

ðŸŒŸ Introduction ðŸŒŸ

The Virtual Herbal Garden is an innovative and immersive platform designed to educate users about medicinal plants. It provides detailed information on each plant, including its botanical and common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and cultivation methods. The platform combines modern technology with traditional knowledge to bridge the gap between ancient herbal practices and contemporary digital solutions. A key feature is the use of image recognition technology, which allows users to identify plants by simply taking pictures.

Core Technology
The Virtual Herbal Garden system integrates several modern technologies to provide a seamless user experience.
AI & Machine Learning
 * Plant Identification: The core of the system is driven by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a powerful machine learning algorithm well-suited for image recognition tasks. This approach simplifies plant identification, making it faster and more accessible to non-experts.
 * Model Architecture: The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers designed to extract features like edges, textures, and colors from plant images. These features are then passed through pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.

 * Training: The model is trained on a prepared dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy to ensure reliable results. Image augmentation techniques (e.g., rotations, flipping) are used to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalizability. The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 85-90%.

 * Frontend: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring cross-device compatibility and an intuitive user experience. Users can upload or take pictures of plants, and the results are dynamically displayed in real-time.
 * Backend: The backend is powered by the Flask web framework, which handles server-side logic and communication between the frontend and the machine learning model. 
Database & Authentication
 * User Authentication: Firebase Authentication is integrated to manage secure user authentication and session handling.
